1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
Because we dont use CDN's anymore and we import it from our DEPENDENCIES i guess locally that's why i guess 

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
Objects not the content as shown in index.html webpage

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
problem is these 2 not in one div, react cannot show siblings they must be in one container or div w/e

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
I forget it but i know the difference between 2 of them: Declarative is answered by "What should be done?" meanwhile Imperative is answered by "How should it be done?"

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
